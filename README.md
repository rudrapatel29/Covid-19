# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data, focusing on trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination distribution by country and vaccine manufacturer. The aim is to visualize the spread and impact of the pandemic across different regions and to provide insights into the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines globally.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on every country across the globe. This project leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to explore and uncover insights from COVID-19 datasets. The analysis covers:

- **Total Cases Analysis:** Visualization of the cumulative COVID-19 cases across countries.
- **Death Analysis:** Identification of the countries with the highest death tolls due to COVID-19.
- **Vaccination Analysis:** Analysis of vaccine distribution by company and country.

## Project Goals

- **Trend Analysis:** Understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 by analyzing the trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination distribution over time.
- **Vaccine Distribution:** Identify which vaccine companies supplied the most vaccines to the top affected countries.
- **Country-specific Impact:** Explore the specific impact of COVID-19 on individual countries in terms of cases and deaths.

## Datasets

This project uses the following datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Cases Data:** Contains the number of new cases reported by each country on a daily basis.
2. **COVID-19 Vaccination Data:** Includes details on vaccination campaigns by country, including the type of vaccines used and the number of doses administered.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### 1. **Trend Analysis of COVID-19 Cases:**
   - Analysis of the total cases over time across different countries.
   - Visualization of the trends using line charts to identify surges and declines.

### 2. **Death Toll Analysis:**
   - Identification of countries with the highest number of deaths.
   - Bar charts to visualize the total deaths per country.

### 3. **Vaccine Distribution Analysis:**
   - Grouping and counting the vaccine distribution by company and country.
   - Bar plots to visualize the top vaccine suppliers.

### 4. **Map Visualization:**
   - Choropleth maps showing the total number of COVID-19 cases per country.
   - Geospatial analysis to understand the global spread of the virus.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** Plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn:** Advanced visualization.
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation for interactive visualization.

## Key Findings

- **Case Trends:** The analysis reveals the timelines of peak cases across different countries.
- **Vaccine Impact:** Insights into which vaccines were most widely distributed and their impact on case numbers.
- **Country Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of the countries most affected by the pandemic, with visual evidence of the trends in cases and deaths.

## Conclusion

This project provides a detailed analysis of COVID-19's global impact, offering insights into the progression of the pandemic, its effects on different countries, and the distribution of vaccines. The visualizations and findings can help inform ongoing efforts to manage and mitigate the spread of the virus.
